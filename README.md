Looked at position and height and era NBA players, to see how that affected different aspects of scoring such a points, free throws, and three pointers.
Basketball fans have many theories as to what makes a good scorer. Here, we try to reduce the model of what makes players score to positions and physical characteristics. We used a linear model to predict what contributes to high scoring. The model has minimal predictive power, explaining a low proportion of the overall variance in NBA scoring.
